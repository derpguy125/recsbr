quote wakes up in start point from vanilla CS
but it's different because it's styled like the
BEYTAH

get the =doggie gun=, can go off to the tall area
extra exit blocked off by wall, cannot reach with
current jump height

go to bottom, enter "desolate town"

talk to the locals around, go to top right
beat PUU

mimiga outside right of boss room says something like
"Wait! Don't go out. I want to
talk to you."
if you try leaving without talking to them

and if you talk to them,
"You there. You're one of those
robot soldiers from the surface.
...Huh? The Doctor? Red Flowers?
Ballos? No idea what you're
talking about, sorry.
Heh, well whatever. You want to
get out of here, huh?
Out of the DREAMSCAPE?
Hah, well good luck with that.
Our best soldiers never came
back when we sent them out
looking for an exit.
Poor, poor Arthur. His younger
sister was disheartened for
months when we told her
that he most likely disappeared
looking for our way out.
...You however. You seem to be
different. You may be the key
to our liberation from the
DREAMSCAPE.
I must warn you, however.
The places you must travel
through are completely different
from the ones near our village.
Be careful, and we might be
able to get out of this
wretched place.
Godspeed, Soldier."

You are allowed into the next area which is...
literally the i wanna be the guy place lmao

going through you can enter some other areas
but in the iwbtg area, you can find the kid in an
area you cant get through with your jump height

he like gives you his cape because he just
wants to retire or something

which allows you to double jump, being
like a nerfed booster 0.8
